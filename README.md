GNUBot is an open-source bot built using JavaScript. It is designed to be free with freedom, offering a user-friendly deployment experience in local environments. GNUBot adheres to the following principles:

- It will never demand payment for its services.
- Your members will never encounter advertisements by GNUBot.
- Subscription fees will never be part of GNUBot's model.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of now, all code changes intended for development testing and potential future releases are in the dev branch.
>
> The GNUBot Project is still in active development, and any development code is subject to change. There is currently no stable release, and the codebase may undergo significant modifications.

#### Why make this? Why Open Source?

I prefer having choices. Many Discord bots charge for basic features that Discord already provides, like welcome messages. This project makes those features free, breaking away from unnecessary subscriptions.

#### When stable release?

When the first release is published. It will take quite some time to make a Discord bot from scratch.

#### Why make this? Why Open Source?

I prefer having choices. Many Discord bots charge for basic features that Discord already provides, like welcome messages. This project makes those features free, breaking away from unnecessary subscriptions.

#### When stable release?

When it is stable.. that is far away from now..
